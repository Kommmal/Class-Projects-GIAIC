# Write a program that prints out the calls for a spaceship that is about to launch. Countdown from 10 to 1 and then output Liftoff!

# Here's a sample run of the program:

# 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Liftoff!


def main():

    for i in range(10, 0, -1):
        print(i, end=" ")
    print("Liftoff!")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
